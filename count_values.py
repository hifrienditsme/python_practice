# Below you can see a student_grades list. Your task is to use Python to count how many items with
# a value of 10.0 are in the student_grades list. Once you find the proper list method that counts
# items, then print out its output using a print() function.

student_grades = [9.1, 8.8, 10.0, 7.7, 6.8, 8.0, 10.0, 8.1, 10.0, 9.9]

countten = list.count(student_grades, 10)
print(countten)
