#Please write a program which asks the user for a number. The program then prints out the number as multiplied by five.
#The program should function like the following sample output:
#Please type in a number: 3
#3 times 5 is 15
user_number = int(input("Please type in a number: "))
times_five = user_number * 5

print(f"{user_number} times 5 is {times_five}")
